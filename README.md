🔍 This project uses the classic Iris dataset to train a machine learning model that classifies flowers into Setosa, Versicolor, or Virginica based on their sepal and petal measurements.
🧠 Built using Python, scikit-learn, and logistic regression, it demonstrates key concepts in supervised learning, data preprocessing, and evaluation.
📊 Includes accuracy metrics and a visual confusion matrix for performance analysis.
